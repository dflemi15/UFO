# UFO

Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to provide consumers with a JavaScript powered webpage that provides searchable data on UFO sightings around the US.  For those who are curious about the activities of our extraterrestrial visitors, this website is the perfect place to gather information on time, location, and description of the encounter in a clear and consolidated format.

Results

Upon entering the webpage, visitors will be greeted with the following passage:

As they scroll down further, they will encounter the main feature of this webpage: the Filter Search feature. This will allow visitors to provide basic instructions in the search fields to identify the time, location, or object type of the encounter they are looking for. For instance, if the visitor is looking for encounters that occurred on 1/1/2010 in Arkansas, they need only provide this information in the search criteria for those fields and the Filter Search feature will automatically provide the search results on screen.

This feature is simple to use and provides easily accessible information for those looking for answers.

Summary

One of the drawbacks of this application is the limitations of the data. The application includes a search feature that allows for a search by country, however, the data only provides information for the US. To increase the scope of this application, inclusion of sightings in other parts of the world may allow for a more robust experience.

With the increase in locational data on event locations, a heatmap feature may allow for better visualization and tracking of locational trends. This feature can be implemented by using “heatmap” type in the “Plotly” package of JavaScript. 

In keeping with the charting of data theme, implementing a dynamic pie chart to illustrate the percentages of sightings per state or country could also provide interesting and exciting data for the visitors interested in gaining deeper insight. This could also be accomplished by leveraging Plotly in JavaScript.
